# My extended vim config

The config was extended from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
Keep in here for backup.

## Note to self
- install [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to have [oil](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) be able to display icons nvim plugin.
Otherwise, we will get a `?` with square box around it.

On mac,
```
brew install font-hack-nerd-font
```
and set iterm to use nerd font. [*](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72973274)
